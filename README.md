## Overview

VISION is a program that emulates a LED matrix marquee on a computer monitor. Information
is formed by the selective lighting of the matrix elements. A message in VISION is comprised
of one or more segments, either text or image. These segments are displayed in succession
with various possible message and segment-specific settings, including repeats, delays, and
special effects.
